This is web application for playing darts.

It consists of svg dart board with clickable fields. After you set the starting parameters (number of players, starting points, "double in" or "double out"),
you start playing by simply clicking on the dart board at field where you dart has landed.

After that the code takes over and calculates everything. No need (and no option, too) to change the active player, the app does that for you, and it shows the active player by
bordering with red line.

The game captions are in Serbian.
